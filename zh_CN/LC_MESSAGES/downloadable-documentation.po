#: ../../../downloadable-documentation.rst:17
msgid ""
"This functionality is great for anyone who needs documentation when they "
"aren't connected to the internet. Users who are about to get on a plane can "
"grab a single file and have the entire documentation during their trip. Many "
"academic and scientific projects benefit from these additional formats."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../downloadable-documentation.rst:21
msgid ""
"PDF versions are also helpful to automatically **create printable versions "
"of your documentation**. The source of your documentation will be structured "
"to support both online and offline formats. This means that a documentation "
"project displayed as a website can be downloaded as a PDF, ready to be "
"printed as a report or a book."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../downloadable-documentation.rst:26
msgid ""
"Offline formats also support having the entire documentation in a single "
"file. Your entire documentation can now be delivered as an email attachment, "
"uploaded to an eReader, or accessed and searched locally without online "
"latency. This makes your documentation project **easy to redistribute or "
"archive**."

"Downloadable documentation formats are built by your documentation "
"framework. They are then published by Read the Docs and included in your :"
"term:`Flyout menu`. Therefore, it's your framework that decides exactly how "

"The common case for most documentation frameworks is that several "
"alternative extensions exist supporting various output formats. Most of the "
"extensions export the HTML outputs as another format (for instance PDF) "
"through a conversion process."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../downloadable-documentation.rst:72
msgid ""
"Because Sphinx supports the generation of offline formats through an "
"official process, we are also able to support it officially. Other "
"alternatives can also work, provided that you identify which extension you "
"want to use and configure the environment for it to run. **Other formats "
"aren't natively supported by Read the Docs, but support is coming soon.**"
