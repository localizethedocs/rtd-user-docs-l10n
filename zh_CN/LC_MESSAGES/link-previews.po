"Link previews allows you to see the content of the link you are about to "
"click when you hover over it. This gives you the ability to quickly preview "
"where a link points, so you can keep your context while reading but learn "

"We perform some heuristic to detect the documentation tool used to generate "
"the page based on its HTML structure. This auto-detection may fail, "
"resulting in the content rendered inside the popup being incorrect. If you "
"are experiencing this, you can specify the CSS selector for the main content "
"in :guilabel:`Settings > Addons > Advanced`, or you can `open an issue in "
"the addons repository <https://github.com/readthedocs/addons>`_ so we "
"improve our heuristic."
