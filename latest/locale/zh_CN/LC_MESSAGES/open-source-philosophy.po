"However, as a project there are things that we care about more than others. "
"We built Read the Docs to support documentation in the open source "
"community. The code is open for people to contribute to, so that they may "
"build features into https://app.readthedocs.org that they want. We also "
"believe sharing the code openly is a valuable learning tool, especially for "
"demonstrating how to collaborate and maintain an enormous website."

"Read the Docs was founded to improve documentation in the open source "

"time is limited, and we want to spend it on the mission that we set out to "
"originally support."

"If you feel strongly about installing Read the Docs internal to a company, "
