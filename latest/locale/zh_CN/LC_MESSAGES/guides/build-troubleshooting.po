"**Resolution:** This error can be quite misleading. It usually occurs when a "

"**Resolution:** A specified branch does not exist in the git repository. "
"This might be because the git repository was recently created (and has no "
"commits nor branches) or because the default branch has changed name. If for "
"instance, the default branch on GitHub changed from ``master`` to ``main``, "
"you need to visit :guilabel:`Admin > Settings` to change the name of the "
"default branch that Read the Docs expects to find when cloning the "
