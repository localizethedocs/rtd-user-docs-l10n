"By default, Read the Docs assumes that your documentation is or *might "
"become* multilingual one day. The initial default language is English and "
"therefore you often see the initial build of your documentation published at "
"``/en/latest/``, where the ``/en`` denotes that it's in English. By having "
"the ``en`` URL component present from the beginning, you are ready for the "
"eventuality that you would want a second language."

"It is easy to set the *Language* of your project. On the project *Admin* "
