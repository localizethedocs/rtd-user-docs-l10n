"Privacy levels allow you to set the visibility of your project and its "
"versions. This allows you to specify what information is available to the "
"public and what is private. Privacy can be controlled at the level of the "
"project and each version, and nothing more granular (eg. specific "
"directories or URLs) can be controlled."
