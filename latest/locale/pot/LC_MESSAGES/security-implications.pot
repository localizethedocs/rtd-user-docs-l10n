"This article explains the security implications of documentation pages, this "

"to documentation pages (readthedocs.io, readthedocs-hosted.com, and custom "
"domains)."

"Read the Docs allows `cross-origin requests`_ for documentation resources it "
"serves. However, internal and proxied APIs, typically found under the ``/_/"
"`` path don't allow cross-origin requests."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:19

"To facilitate this, the following headers are added to all responses from "
"documentation pages:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:21
msgid "``Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:22
msgid "``Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, HEAD, OPTIONS``"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:24
msgid ""
"These headers allow cross-origin requests from any origin and only allow the "
"GET, HEAD and OPTIONS methods. It's important to note that passing "
"credentials (such as cookies or HTTP authentication) in cross-origin "
"requests is not allowed, ensuring access to public resources only."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:30
msgid ""
"Having cross-origin requests enabled allows third-party websites to make use "
"of files from your documentation (as long as they are public), which allows "
"various third-party integrations to work."
msgstr ""

msgid ""
"If needed, the ``Access-Control`` headers can be changed for your "
"documentation pages by :doc:`contacting support </support>`. **You are "
"responsible for providing the correct values for these headers, and making "
"sure they don't break your documentation pages.**"

msgid ""
"On |com_brand|, we use cookies to store user sessions. These cookies are set "
"when a user authenticates to access private documentation. Session cookies "
"have the ``SameSite`` attribute set to ``None``, which allows them to be "
"sent in cross-origin requests where allowed (see :ref:`security-implications:"
"Cross-origin requests`), for example, when embedding private documentation "
"pages in an iframe (see :ref:`security-implications:Embedding documentation "
"pages`)."

msgid ""
"Embedding documentation pages in an iframe is allowed. Read the Docs doesn't "
"set the ``X-Frame-Options`` or ``Content-Security-Policy`` headers, which "
"means that the browser's default behavior is used."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:58
msgid ""
"Embedding private documentation pages in an iframe is possible, but it "
"requires users to be previously authenticated in the embedded domain."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../security-implications.rst:61
msgid ""
"It's important to note that embedding documentation pages in an iframe does "
"not grant the parent page access the iframe's content. Documentation pages "
"serve static content only, and the exposed APIs are read-only, making the "
"exploitation of a clickjacking vulnerability very unlikely."
