"Trying to figure out how to pass up-to-date information to AI agents is a "
"hard problem. We have experimented with MCP servers and ``llms.txt``, but we "
"have found that `Agent Skills <https://agentskills.io/home>`_ are the "
"current best way to handle this problem explicitly."

"`Read the Docs Skills <https://github.com/readthedocs/skills>`_ are a "
"collection of Agent Skills that help AI agents work with Read the Docs APIs "
"and configuration. They are designed to keep agent output aligned with our "
"documented behavior and reduce manual verification. This page highlights two "
"foundational skills that cover the most common workflows: the Read the Docs "
"API skill and the Read the Docs Config Writer skill."

"A skill is a small, self-contained package with a ``SKILL.md`` that teaches "
"an agent how to perform a specific task. Skills are automatically discovered "
"by compatible agents. When a request matches a skill description, the agent "
"loads the relevant ``SKILL.md`` and follows its steps. To learn more about "
"Agent Skills, see the `Agent Skills home page <https://agentskills.io/"
