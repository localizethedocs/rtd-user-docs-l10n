"A `canonical URL`_ allows you to specify the preferred version of a web page "
"to prevent duplicated content. Here are some examples of when a canonical "
"URL is used:"

"Search engines use your canonical URL to link users to the correct version "
"and domain of your documentation."

"Many popular chat clients and social media networks generate link previews, "
"using your canonical URL as the final destination."

"If canonical URLs aren't used, it's easy for outdated documentation to be "
"the top search result for various pages in your documentation. This is not a "
"perfect solution for this problem, but generally people finding outdated "
"documentation is a big problem, and this is one of the suggested ways to "
"solve it from search engines."

"For example, if you have a project named ``example-docs`` with a custom "
"domain ``https://docs.example.com``, then your documentation will be served "
"at ``https://example-docs.readthedocs.io`` and ``https://docs.example.com``. "
"Without specifying a canonical URL, a search engine like Google will index "
"both domains."

#: ../../../canonical-urls.rst:34
msgid ""
"You'll want to use ``https://docs.example.com`` as your canonical domain. "
"This means that when Google indexes a page like ``https://example-docs."
"readthedocs.io/en/latest/``, it will know that it should really point at "
"``https://docs.example.com/en/latest/``, thus avoiding duplicating the "
"content."

#: ../../../canonical-urls.rst:41
msgid ""
"If you want your custom domain to be set as the canonical, you need to set "
"``Canonical:  This domain is the primary one where the documentation is "
"served from`` in the :guilabel:`Admin` > :guilabel:`Domains` section of your "
"project settings."

"A canonical URL is automatically passed to the build process as "
"``READTHEDOCS_CANONICAL_URL`` :doc:`environment variable </reference/"
"environment-variables>`. You can use this variable to configure your "
"documentation tool to use it (eg. Sphinx does this via the ``html_baseurl`` "
"config, MkDocs via ``site_url`` and Pelican with ``SITEURL``)"
