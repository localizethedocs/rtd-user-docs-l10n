#: ../../../unofficial-projects.rst:11

"Documentation projects may be kept online indefinitely, even though a newer "

"While Read the Docs is not a backup service, the core team of Read the Docs "
"does their best to keep content accessible indefinitely in its published "
"form. However, in certain edge cases, the greater community's needs might "
"outweigh the individual's expectation of continued publishing."

msgid "Prior art"
msgstr ""

#: ../../../unofficial-projects.rst:120
msgid ""
"This policy is inspired by our :doc:`abandoned-projects`. The Python Package "
"Index (PyPI) policy for claiming abandoned packages (`PEP-0541 <https://www."
"python.org/dev/peps/pep-0541>`_) heavily influenced this policy."
