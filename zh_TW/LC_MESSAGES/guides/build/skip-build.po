"Read the Docs provides a special build cancellation mechanism that allows "
"you to programmatically skip builds based on custom conditions. This is "
"useful when you want to avoid unnecessary documentation builds, saving build "
"time and resources."

msgid ""
"When any command in your build process exits with the special exit code "
"``183``, Read the Docs will immediately cancel the build. The build will be "

"point."

"The 256 modulo operation is necessary because `Unix exit codes are limited "
