"You may be familiar with using the :ref:`:ref: role <sphinx:ref-role>` to :"
"doc:`link to any location of your docs </guides/cross-referencing-with-"

"Sometimes you may need to link to a specific section of another project's "
"documentation. While you could just hyperlink directly, there is a better "
"way. :doc:`Intersphinx <sphinx:usage/extensions/intersphinx>` allows you to "
"use all :ref:`cross-reference roles <sphinx:xref-syntax>` from Sphinx with "
"objects in other projects. That is, you could use the ``:ref:`` role to link "
"to sections of other documentation projects. Sphinx will ensure that your "
"cross-references to the other project exist and will raise a warning if they "
