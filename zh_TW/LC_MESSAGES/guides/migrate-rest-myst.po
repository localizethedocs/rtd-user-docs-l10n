"Sphinx is usually associated with reStructuredText, the markup language {pep}"
"`designed for the CPython project in the early '00s <287>`. However, for "
"quite some time Sphinx has been compatible with Markdown as well, thanks to "
"a number of extensions."

"The most powerful of such extensions is {doc}`MyST-Parser <myst-parser:"

"dialect with support for the Sphinx roles and directives that make it so "
"useful."

"It is useful to ask whether a migration is necessary in the first place. "
"Doing bulk migrations of large projects with lots of work in progress will "

"for whatever reason. Luckily, Sphinx supports reading both types of markup "
"at the same time without problems."
