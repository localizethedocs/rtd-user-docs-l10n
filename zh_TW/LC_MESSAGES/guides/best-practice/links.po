"Sources of incoming links vary greatly depending on the type of "

"old emails to GitHub issues, wiki articles, software comments, PDF "

"not in your control."

"You might be familiar with the concept of `permalinks`_ from blogging. The "
"idea is that a blog post receives a unique link as soon as it's published "

"changes."
