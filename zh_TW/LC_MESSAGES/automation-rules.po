"Automation rules allow project maintainers to automate actions on new "
"branches and tags in Git repositories. If you are familiar with :term:"
"`GitOps`, this might seem familiar. The goal of automation rules is to be "
"able to control versioning through your Git repository and avoid duplicating "
"these efforts on Read the Docs."
