"A documentation project's ultimate goal is to be read and understood by a "
"reader. Readers need to be able to :term:`discover <discoverability>` the "
"information that they need. Without an defined structure, readers either "
"won't find information that they need or get frustrated on the way."

"One of the largest benefits of a good structure is that it removes questions "
"that keep authors from writing documentation. Starting with a blank page is "
"often the hardest part of documentation, so anything we can do to remove "
"this problem is a win."
