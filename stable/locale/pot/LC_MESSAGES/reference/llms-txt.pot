msgid ""
"The ``llms.txt`` file will be served from the **default version** of your "
"project at ``https://your-project.readthedocs.io/llms.txt``. This is because "
"the ``llms.txt`` file is served at the top-level of your domain, so we must "
"choose a version to find the file in. The **default version** is the best "
"place to look for it."
