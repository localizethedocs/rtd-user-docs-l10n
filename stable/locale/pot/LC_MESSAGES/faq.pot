msgid ""
"Projects have the status \"failing\" because something in the build process "
"has failed. This can be because the project is not correctly configured, "
"because the contents of the Git repository cannot be built, or in the most "
"rare cases because a system that Read the Docs connects to is not working."

#: ../../../faq.rst:50
msgid "Another use case for this is when you have a module with a C extension."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq.rst:52
msgid ""
"This happens because the build system does not have the dependencies for "

"g. ``libevent`` or ``mysql``). For libraries that cannot be :ref:`installed "
"via apt <config-file/v2:build.apt_packages>` in the builder there is another "
"way to successfully build the documentation despite missing dependencies."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq.rst:58
msgid ""
"With Sphinx you can use the built-in `autodoc_mock_imports`_ for mocking. If "

"When Read the Docs builds your project, it sets the :envvar:`READTHEDOCS` "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq.rst:188
msgid ""
"The main reason for this is that all existing URLs to the content will "

msgstr ""

#: ../../../faq.rst:276
msgid ""
"Yes. One criticism of Sphinx is that its annotated docstrings are too dense "
"and difficult for humans to read. In response, many projects have adopted "
"customized docstring styles that are simultaneously informative and legible. "
"The `NumPy <https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-"
"standard>`__ and `Google <https://google.github.io/styleguide/pyguide."
"html#38-comments-and-docstrings>`__ styles are two popular docstring "
"formats.  Fortunately, the default Read the Docs theme handles both formats "
"just fine, provided your ``conf.py`` specifies an appropriate Sphinx "
"extension that knows how to convert your customized docstrings.  Two such "
"extensions are `numpydoc <https://github.com/numpy/numpydoc>`_ and `napoleon "
"<http://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io>`_. Only ``napoleon`` is able "
"to handle both docstring formats. Its default output more closely matches "
"the format of standard Sphinx annotations, and as a result, it tends to look "
"a bit better with the default theme."
