"Read the Docs largely funds our operations and development through "
"advertising. However, we aren't willing to compromise our values, document "
"authors, or site visitors simply to make a bit more money. That's why we "
"created our :doc:`ethical advertising <ethical-advertising>` initiative."

"We get a lot of inquiries about our approach to advertising which range from "
"questions about our practices to requests to partner. The goal of this "
"document is to shed light on the advertising industry, exactly what we do "
"for advertising, and how what we do is different. If you have questions or "
"comments, `send us an email <mailto:ads@readthedocs.org>`_ or `open an issue "
"on GitHub <https://github.com/readthedocs/readthedocs.org/issues>`_."

"Some ad networks build a database of user data in order to predict the types "
"of ads that are likely to be clicked. In the advertising industry, this is "
"called *behavioral targeting*. This can include data such as:"

msgid ""
"Typically, getting a user's page visit history is accomplished by the use of "
"trackers (sometimes called beacons or pixels). For example, if a site uses a "
"tracker from an ad network and a user visits that site, the site can now "
"target future advertising to that user -- a known past visitor -- with that "
"network. This is called *retargeting*."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../advertising/advertising-details.rst:41
msgid ""
"Other ad predictions are made by grouping similar users together based on "
"user data using machine learning. Frequently this involves an advertiser "
"uploading personal data on users (often past customers of the advertiser) to "
"an ad network and telling the network to target similar users. The idea is "
"that two users with similar demographic information and similar interests "
"would like the same products. In ad tech, this is known as *lookalike "
"audiences* or *similar audiences*."

"Google Analytics is a contentious issue inside Read the Docs and in our "

"Advertisers ask us questions that are easily answered with an analytics "

msgstr ""

msgid ""
"Run a different cloud analytics solution from a provider other than Google "
"(eg. Parse.ly, Matomo Cloud, Adobe Analytics). We priced a couple of these "
"out based on our load and they are very expensive. They also just substitute "
"one problem of data sharing with another."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../advertising/advertising-details.rst:135
msgid ""
"Send data to GA (or another cloud analytics provider) on the server side and "
"strip or anonymize personal data such as IPs before sending them. This would "
"be a complex solution and involve additional infrastructure, but it would "
"have many advantages. It would result in a loss of data on \"sessions\" and "
"new vs. returning visitors which are of limited value to us."

"Run a local JavaScript based analytics solution (eg. Matomo community). This "

"Run a local analytics solution based on web server log parsing. This has the "
"same infrastructure problems as above while also not capturing all the data "
"we want (without additional engineering) like the programming language of "
"the docs being shown or whether the docs are built with Sphinx or something "
"else."
